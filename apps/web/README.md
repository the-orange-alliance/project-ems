## Setting up a development environment

### Initialing husky for pre-commits
Make sure you run `npm install`, and afterwards go ahead and do `npm run preprepare`, or just wait
until you have a commit ready and the `prepare` script will automatically install husky for you!

### VSCode
Make sure you install the following extensions:
1. Editorconfig for VSCode
2. ESLint
3. Prettier - Code formatter

Then, open the command palette and modify the following settings:
1. Editor: Default Formatter
2. Editor: Format On Save
